JiSeok Yoon, thank you for your cooperation!


## Lung Nodula Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) 

This project for pulmonary nodule detection systems FP reduction.
We use LUNA16 challenge dataset.

- https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/ 

## Results

We participated in the competition and got the following CPMs:

- MILAB_ConcatCAD: rank 3 (2017.11.25)
- MILAB_RedCAD@: rank 8 (2017.11.25)

@:The submissions with '@'' used the initially provided 
list of nodule candidates computed using fewer candidate detection algorithms.
